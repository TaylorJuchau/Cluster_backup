PROBLEM DISASTER I could not open the file SED/fsps_iso.ascii

These are all the paths I tried:
   ==/d/ret1/Taylor/jupyter_notebooks/Research/CLOUDY_stuff/SED/fsps_iso.ascii==
   ==/d/ret1/Taylor/jupyter_notebooks/Research/CLOUDY_stuff/fsps_iso.ascii==
   ==/d/ret1/Taylor/CLOUDY/c23.01/data/SED/fsps_iso.ascii==
   ==/d/ret1/Taylor/CLOUDY/c23.01/data/fsps_iso.ascii==

Although there may be other reasons you have received this
error, the most likely is that you mistyped the file name.
It is is also possible that the path has not been properly set. It
should point to the data directory you downloaded from the web site.

Please use "make" to compile the code. This will automatically
set the path correctly. Alternatively you can set the environment
variable CLOUDY_DATA_PATH to define the data directory search path
using the shell command 
export CLOUDY_DATA_PATH="<search path>"
from a bash command prompt.

Sorry.
